# XmlPrettify

This application is a command-line tool built using .NET that aims to provide a convenient way to format XML files. It takes an XML file as input, applies proper indentation and formatting to the XML content, and saves the formatted XML to a new file. 

Features
- Indentation and Formatting: The application automatically indents the XML content, ensuring that the elements and their hierarchy are visually represented in a structured manner. This improves the readability of the XML file, making it easier to the structure of the XML file.
- Support for Long Lines: The application handles XML files with long lines by preserving the integrity of the content. This ensures that long lines are not truncated or broken, maintaining the original content of the XML file.
- Attribute Sorting: The application can optionally sort the attributes of each XML element in alphabetical order. This consistent attribute ordering simplifies the comparison of different XML files and improves the overall consistency of the XML structure.
- Attribute Filtering: The application can optionally filter the attributes of each XML element. This simplifies the comparison of different XML files where some on the attributtes should be ignored.
